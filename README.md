# Javascript-Flowerpot

Javascript based application, that communicates with the wonderbar through mqtt

The app currently runs in simulation mode and the bootstrap stylesheet is
missing. The bootstrap installation will be automated, as I don't want to
provide third party libraries in this repository. The code is not mine to
distribute and it should not be duplicated.
